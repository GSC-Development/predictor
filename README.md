## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Security

This app implements security best practices:

- **API Keys**: All external API keys are stored server-side only and never exposed to the client
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth handles user authentication securely
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data is stored in environment variables that are git-ignored
- **Server-Side API Calls**: External API calls are made from Next.js API routes, not client-side

## API Routes

- `/api/fixtures` - Fetch football fixtures from API Football
- `/api/teams` - Fetch team information and logos
- `/api/sync` - Sync fixture data with Firestore
